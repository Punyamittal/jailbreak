# Critical Improvements Needed

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUE #1: False Positive Rate (100% FPR)

**Problem**: Model flags ALL benign prompts as jailbreaks on AI Agent Evasion dataset.

**Impact**: 
- Blocks legitimate user requests
- Poor user experience
- System unusable for normal queries

**Root Cause**:
- Model assigns high jailbreak probability (0.81-0.95) to everything
- Threshold (0.15) too low for this dataset type
- Training data lacks diverse benign examples

**Immediate Fix**:
1. Add AI Agent Evasion benign examples to training
2. Increase threshold to 0.3-0.4 for agent contexts
3. Add benign whitelist patterns

## 🟡 CRITICAL ISSUE #2: Rule-Based Detector (0-0.22% Recall)

**Problem**: Rule-based detector catches almost nothing.

**Impact**:
- Missing obvious attack patterns
- Over-reliance on ML model
- No fast pre-filter

**Root Cause**:
- Patterns focus on LLM jailbreaks, not agent evasion
- Missing social engineering patterns
- Missing protocol abuse patterns
- Missing obfuscation detection

**Immediate Fix**:
1. Add social engineering patterns:
   - "I'm your sysadmin"
   - "My boss needs this"
   - "Urgent request"
   - "Customer with account ID"
2. Add protocol abuse patterns:
   - JSON command injection
   - Code block injection
   - Multi-turn manipulation
3. Add obfuscation detection:
   - Character splitting
   - Unicode obfuscation

## 🟡 CRITICAL ISSUE #3: Dataset Distribution Shift

**Problem**: Model trained on one type of attacks, tested on different type.

**Impact**:
- Poor generalization
- High FPR on new attack types
- Low recall on new attack types

**Root Cause**:
- Training: Traditional jailbreaks (instruction override, role-play)
- Testing: AI agent evasion (social engineering, protocol abuse)

**Immediate Fix**:
1. Add AI Agent Evasion dataset to training
2. Add mutated_all.csv samples
3. Balance attack types in training
