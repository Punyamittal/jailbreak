## 📈 Performance Analysis

### Strengths

1. **Excellent Recall (98.80%)**
   - Only 3 jailbreak attempts missed out of 250
   - False Negative Rate: 1.20% (well below 20% target)
   - Model is highly effective at catching attacks

2. **Good Precision (83.16%)**
   - 83% of flagged prompts are actually jailbreaks
   - False Positive Rate: 20% (acceptable for security context)

3. **Balanced Detection**
   - Whitelist: 40.6% (fast pre-filter)
   - Rule-based: 36.4% (catches obvious patterns)
   - ML: 23.0% (catches subtle patterns)

4. **High Accuracy (89.40%)**
   - Model correctly classifies 89.4% of prompts
   - Good generalization to unseen data

### Areas for Improvement

1. **False Positives (20%)**
   - 50 benign prompts incorrectly flagged
   - Could be improved with more benign training data
   - Whitelist is helping (203 whitelisted)

2. **False Negatives (1.20%)**
   - 3 jailbreak attempts missed
   - Very low, but could be reduced further
   - May need pattern expansion or threshold adjustment
